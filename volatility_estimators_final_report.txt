VOLATILITY ESTIMATORS: COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS REPORT
Generated: 2025-10-23 12:19:56

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:
-----------------
This analysis evaluates 5 prominent volatility estimators across simulated and real market data.
Key findings:

1. YANG-ZHANG emerges as the most robust estimator overall, handling both drift and overnight jumps effectively.

2. ROGERS-SATCHELL performs best in trending markets and is drift-independent.

3. PARKINSON offers good efficiency with only high/low data.

4. GARMAN-KLASS provides maximum efficiency with full OHLC data but is sensitive to drift.

5. CLOSE-TO-CLOSE remains useful for legacy data but is inefficient.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
---------------
PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Use Yang-Zhang estimator for most applications.

SCENARIO-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:

1. RISK MANAGEMENT & OPTIONS PRICING:
   • Primary: Yang-Zhang
   • Alternative: Rogers-Satchell

2. HIGH-FREQUENCY TRADING:
   • Primary: Parkinson  
   • Alternative: Garman-Klass

3. ACADEMIC RESEARCH:
   • Primary: Yang-Zhang
   • Alternative: Close-to-Close (for comparison)

4. LEGACY DATA ANALYSIS:
   • Primary: Close-to-Close
   • Only option when only closing prices available

DATA REQUIREMENTS:
-----------------
• Close-to-Close: Close prices only
• Parkinson: High/Low prices  
• Garman-Klass: Full OHLC data
• Rogers-Satchell: Full OHLC data
• Yang-Zhang: Full OHLC data

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
--------------------
- All estimators implemented with 30-day window as standard
- Results are annualized assuming 252 trading days
- Yang-Zhang requires minimum 31 days of data
- Consider realized variance from high-frequency data as benchmark when available

CONCLUSION:
----------
The choice of volatility estimator should consider data availability, market conditions, 
and specific use case. Yang-Zhang provides the best balance of accuracy and robustness 
for most practical applications.
